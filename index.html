            <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
            <p>Our story began at Starbucks, where Logan joined the company in December 2021 and was assigned to train under Nick. During our time working together, we quickly formed a connection that grew effortlessly. What started with shared meals and after-work hangouts blossomed into a deep bond that only strengthened over time. By May 12th of the following year, we officially became a couple, and soon after, we started building a life together.

                In January 2023, we took the leap and moved in together, learning the ins and outs of living as a couple and testing our adulting skills. Just six months later, we welcomed our first addition to the family, Mia, a sweet German Shepherd who brought even more joy to our home.
                
                A year later, we were thrilled to officially purchase our first home in February 2024. As we celebrated this exciting milestone and our new chapter, Nick proposed in our very own home, marking a beautiful and unforgettable moment in our journey together.</p>
